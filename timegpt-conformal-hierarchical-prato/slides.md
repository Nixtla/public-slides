> Conclusions

- Conformal Prediction offers accurate uncertainty quantification for sparse methods.
- Is more accurate than traditional approaches measured by sCRPS.
- Offers an interesting alternative to uncertainty quantification for new hierarchical time series forecasting methods.

--- 

> Future Work

- Explore other non-conformity measures for better calibration.
- Expand to multivariate hierarchical time series.
- Integration with other forecasting models.
